Reading a Text File 
The FileReader readAsText() method enables 
you to read a text file on the local file system. The 
following example shows how to read a text file.  
The web page includes an <input> element that 
enables the user to select a text file on the local 
file system. As soon as the user has selected the 
file, the onLoadTextFile() function reads the file 
and displays its contents as plain text in a 
<textarea> element on the web page.
